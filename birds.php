          The Kakapo is a very interesting bird. It is a nocturnal parrot from New Zealand. However it is also very endangered.
          Very endangered in this case meaning only about 150-200 birds are still living
          One of the reasons it is so endangered is that it cannot fly. This makes it very easy for predators to catch it.
          One might wonder how, evolutionarily a flightless parrot could come to be. Simply put, it had no natural predators
          in New Zealand until humans came so being flightless would have been ok. However, when humans arrived they brought 
          with them cats and rats which could easily hunt the Kakapo. The reason these animals could hunt them so easily is 
          because the Kakapo are stinky and so are their nests. Prior to humans this was ok, as their only predators were 
          other birds who could not smell and so would have no way of finding the Kakapo, but the mammals that humans brought 
          had no difficulties finding them. The Kakapo are a very interesting endangered bird.

          The oilbird is a very interesting bird in its own right. Also, itâ€™s name makes it clear what one of the reasons 
          it is interesting is. It has a lot of oil. Infact local hunt the young birds and use their oil because when it burns 
          it does not give off any scent. However, this is one of the less interesting things about this bird. It is a 
          nocturnal bird that lives its life in caves. At this point one might be able to guess what the next interesting 
          thing is. It uses echolocation like a bat to find its way around. However, unlike a bat, the Oilbird uses 
          frequencies in the range of human hearing when it uses echolocation. For echolocation it will sometimes emit 250 
          clicks per second. It also hovers in the air to pick fruit off of trees. The Oilbird is truly an amazing bird.

            The Gulper Eel, also known as the Pelican Eel, is a deep-sea fish that is found within the ocean’s temperate and tropical areas.
            is an interesting and well known fish due to its bizarre appearance.
            Its head is known to be larger than its body, with a mouth that can be opened wide enough to swallow fish larger than itself. 
            Despite this, analysis from scientists show that they primarily target smaller crustaceans instead of larger prey. 
            As it is a deep-sea fish, it is usually found living in depths ranging from 500 to 6,000 feet. 
            Due to the habitat that these eels live in, it is rare for humans to ever end up seeing one of these creatures naturally. 
            Because of this, a large amount of what we currently know about them come from eels that were accidently caught by deep-sea fishing nets.

            The Red-lipped Batfish is another fish that is quite unusual to see. 
            It is one of the many organisms that were named after scientist Charles Darwin. 
            This interesting fish is often found at depths of 10 to 200 feet within the waters near the Galapagos Islands, as well as off Peru’s coast.
            Its habitat is within the Galapagos Island Marine Protected zone which protects the area’s biodiversity from human actions. 
            The name Red-lipped Batfish was given to it due to its notable red lips. 
            Besides its appearance, the Batfish is also known for its modified fins which allows for it to sit on the seafloor as well as walk. 
            As these fish are not good swimmers, they use their dorsal fins to lure in prey which makes it easier for them to hunt. 
            The Red-lipped Batfish doesn’t have any major predators due to its habitat being so far underwater, but rising sea temperatures might cause problems for the species in the future.

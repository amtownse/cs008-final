            The Mata Mata is an interesting turtle that is found throughout the Amazon in northern South America, in countries like Venezuela, Brazil, and Peru.
            The Mata Mata is well known mostly due to its appearance. 
            They have a triangular, flattened head with a horn on its long snout as well as a shell with spherical cones projecting from it.
            These creatures also have a neck that can end up being longer than their main bodies.
            Mata Matas are solitary creatures and usually do not interact with others of their kind besides mating season. 
            They reside at the bottom of rivers and swamps yet do not display talent for being able to swim. 
            Besides hatchlings and younger turtles, most adults wonâ€™t leave their section of the stream. 
            Because of this, Mata Matas have a unique method of hunting that involves "vacuuming" up small fish and invertebrates which allows them to stay stationary.
            Due to their unique appearance, Mata Matas are popular and are even in the exotic pet trade.

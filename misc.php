            The Mata Mata is an interesting turtle that is found throughout the Amazon in northern South America, in countries like Venezuela, Brazil, and Peru.
            The Mata Mata is well known mostly due to its appearance. 
            They have a triangular, flattened head with a horn on its long snout as well as a shell with spherical cones projecting from it.
            These creatures also have a neck that can end up being longer than their main bodies.
            Mata Matas are solitary creatures and usually do not interact with others of their kind besides mating season. 
            They reside at the bottom of rivers and swamps yet do not display talent for being able to swim. 
            Besides hatchlings and younger turtles, most adults won’t leave their section of the stream. 
            Because of this, Mata Matas have a unique method of hunting that involves "vacuuming" up small fish and invertebrates which allows them to stay stationary.
            Due to their unique appearance, Mata Matas are popular and are even in the exotic pet trade.

            Wallace’s Flying Frog, also known as the Abah River flying frog or parachute frogs, are a type of amphibian that has the ability to glide up to 50 feet.
            They acquired their name from a biologist named Alfred Wallace who was the first scientist to collect the specimen. 
            These small animals are usually found inhabiting dense jungles in Asia. 
            They are a unique and interesting species due to being able to glide as well as swim and hop. 
            Wallace’s Flying Frogs spend most of their time in trees, only coming down for mating and egg laying.
            When they are searching for insects to eat or escaping from potential predators like tree snakes, they will leap from the tree branches and glide to the many surrounding trees.
            The population is currently healthy and abundant but could possibly be impacted by the dwindling Asian rhino count as they often use holes created by the rhinos to lay eggs.

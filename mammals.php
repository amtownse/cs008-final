            The Jerboa is an interesting rodent known for its kangaroo-esque hopping. 
            There are many different species of Jerboa, with some experts saying there are up to 30. 
            These rodents are often found in the deserts of central Asian countries like Mongolia and China as well as being found in Northern Africa. 
            They are solitary creatures and usually live alone in underground burrows until mating season. 
            In addition to being able to hop around, they are also known for their ability to run at speeds of up to 15 mph when threatened. 
            This allows them to quickly escape from their predators which include foxes, snakes and owls. 
            For food, the Jerboa chooses to eat desert plants and roots. 
            It doesn’t actually drink water naturally, but rather obtains it through the moisture it finds in its foods. 
            These rodents can actually be kept as pets, but are not allowed in the United States due to African rodents being banned by the CDC.

        <!-- Maned Wolf image and info -->
        <p class="needsBackground">
           The Maned Wolf is another mammal that is quite interesting. 
           These quick creatures are usually found within South America including Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. 
           Despite its name, the Maned Wolf is not actually a wolf, but a canid. 
           Unlike real wolves, Maned Wolves are solitary creatures and usually do not interact with each other besides breeding season. 
           Like many species, they use urine and feces to mark their territory from other competitors. 
           The strange thing though is that their urine has been described by many to resemble the smell of cannabis. 
           Unfortunately, Maned Wolf population is currently being threatened by human impacts. 
           The combined effects of habitat loss, introduction of diseases, and being hunted by humans has resulted in the Maned Wolf being put in the “Near Threatened” category by the IUCN and the “Endangered” category by both the USFWS as well as Brazil.

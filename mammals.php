            The Jerboa is an interesting rodent known for its kangaroo-esque hopping. 
            There are many different species of Jerboa, with some experts saying there are up to 30. 
            These rodents are often found in the deserts of central Asian countries like Mongolia and China as well as being found in Northern Africa. 
            They are solitary creatures and usually live alone in underground burrows until mating season. 
            In addition to being able to hop around, they are also known for their ability to run at speeds of up to 15 mph when threatened. 
            This allows them to quickly escape from their predators which include foxes, snakes and owls. 
            For food, the Jerboa chooses to eat desert plants and roots. 
            It doesnâ€™t actually drink water naturally, but rather obtains it through the moisture it finds in its foods. 
            These rodents can actually be kept as pets, but are not allowed in the United States due to African rodents being banned by the CDC.
